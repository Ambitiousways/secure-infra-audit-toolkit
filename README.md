## Project Overview
This project demonstrates practical cybersecurity technician skills used in enterprise and industrial environments.
It focuses on identifying exposed network services, validating configurations against an approved baseline,
and producing audit-ready reports to support remediation and attack surface reduction.

Designed with real-world IT and plant environments in mind (e.g., manufacturing, labs, and enterprise networks),
the toolkit emphasizes safe discovery, port visibility, and operational security best practices.
